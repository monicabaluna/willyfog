# Neo.GPIO
####A python library to control the Gpios, Accel, Gyro, Temp, Baro, Magno sensors/pins easily

###Install
-----------------
To install this package just download the zip and extract the library anwhere your python file will be
EXAMPLE: place the neo folder on your desktop and then create a new python file on the desktop for your program

###Use
-----------------
####INFO: you must run python file as root not udooer or errors might occur like sensor not plugged int<br>
Example on how to to run the files (You can replace the SnapinSensorsExample.py with whatever file you want to run):

        echo udooer | sudo -S su -c 'python SnapinSensorsExample.py'

or<br>

        echo udooer | sudo -S su -c 'python GpioExample.py'


To get started on the Neo use the examples that are provided in the zipped folder. For the Gpio use<br> 
Every pcb port number, which are labeled on the on the board itself<br>

If you don't want to look through the example files here is how to use them<br>

Create a new file outside of the neo folder called gpio.py<br><br>
Import the libraries<br>

    from neo import Gpio
    from time import sleep

Associate with variables and create pins<br>

    gpio = Gpio()
    writepin = 3
    readpin = 2

Set each pin to certain direction (Input/Output)<br>

    gpio.pinMode(writepin, neo.OUTPUT)
    gpio.pinMode(readpin, neo.INPUT)


Lets blink forever and read our second pin (Remember read pin must be pulled fully to either LOW or HIGH not hanging)<br>

    while True:
      gpio.digitalWrite(writepin, neo.HIGH)
      sleep(1)
      gpio.digitalWrite(writepin, neo.LOW)
      sleep(1)
      print "Pin 2 current state is: "+str(gpio.digitalRead(readpin))

Here is a way so that most people who use object oriented way

        from neo import Gpio
        from time import sleep
        
        pin = easyGpio(2) # Pin 2 with LED
        readpin = easyGpio(3) # Pin 3 with switch
        
        pin.pinOUT() # Make pin output 
        readpin.pinIN() # Make pin in
        
        while True:
        	pin.on() # Turn pin on
        	sleep(1) # wait one second
        	pin.off() # Turn pin off
        	print "pin 3 state %d" % readpin.get() # Get current pin state
        	sleep(1)

Yaay if everything worked correctly and you wired the LED and input button correctly then you should be able to read and write values<br>
Remember GPIO is not the only thing you can do with this library you can use all the sensors that are provided currently for the Neo<br>Such as<br>

    Accel()
    Gyro()
    Magno()
    Temp()
    Barometer()

Check them out in the SnapinSensorsExample.py and InBoardSensorsExample.py<br>

####Soon to come PWM (analogWrite/Read) and faster IO and i2c speeds using direct ports and maybe MM files
I just need to know if people are interested in that, message me if so<br>

###Other
-----------------
Don't worry about this library there is a lot of error checking that goes through before sending pin values<br>
The only thing that this won't handle is detecting is the cortex pins are on output, so if you set the cortex pin on output<br>
If you don't know what I mean, just to be safe flash the cortex with the minimal sketch so you don't damage the board<br>
